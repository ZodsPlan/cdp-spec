# CDP Specification

**Controlled Disclosure Protocol (CDP)** is a cryptographic specification for assertion, attribution, and verification of digital content. It allows an author to attach a signature and optional hash to a piece of content (text, media, files) that can be verified by any party, making it ideal for use in:

- Digital attribution
- Anonymous or pseudo-anonymous authorship
- IP protection and licensing
- Verification across media and platforms
- Social and cultural ritualization of trust and verification
